##Atari Breakout

As a part of Hacktoberfest Breakout will be the first game in the game development series.

Atari Breakout is a simple game with ball and paddle from which we have to break the bricks without the ball going below the paddle.

Every step has editable, live samples available to play with so you can see what the intermediate stages should look like. 

You will learn the basics of using the <canvas> element to implement fundamental game mechanics like rendering and moving images, collision detection, control mechanisms, and winning and losing states.

The basic steps through which the development stages of this game would proceed are - 
<ol>
<li>Create the Canvas and draw on it</li>
<li>Move the ball</li>
<li>Bounce off the walls</li>
<li>Paddle and keyboard controls</li>
<li>Game over</li>
<li>Build the brick field</li>
<li>Collision detection</li>
<li>Track the score and win</li>
<li>Mouse controls</li>
<li>Finishing up</li>
</ol>
